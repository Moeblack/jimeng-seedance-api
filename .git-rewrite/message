feat: remove /v1/chat/completions endpoint

- Delete chat route and controller files
- Update routes/index.ts to remove chat references
- Update server.ts error message to be generic
- Update README.md and README.CN.md documentation

This endpoint was a wrapper around images/videos APIs for OpenAI
Chat API compatibility. Direct image/video generation APIs remain
available.
